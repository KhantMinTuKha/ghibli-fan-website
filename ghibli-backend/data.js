      "Excited about reuniting with their ailing mother, close-knit sisters Satsuki and Mei embark on an exciting adventure when they move with their loving professor father to a new house in the verdant countryside of 1950s summer Japan. Now, nothing can stop them. And with mum in the hospital, the girls have all the time in the world to explore nature and the dense adjacent forest, the home of bashful mystical creatures only children can see. Under the clear blue sky's cloudless bliss and the bright yellow sun's promise of a luminous future, nothing can blemish the young sisters' flawless fantasy--not even life's trying times. After all, mother is getting better. Then, one radiant morning, as the shimmering green leaves of the towering camphor trees swayed in the soft morning breeze, the wide-eyed siblings stumbled upon a Totoro. But who is the enchanting visitor? Will the rotund neighbour, with his fluffy fur and mysterious eyes, be the girls' forever friend?—Nick Riganas",

    review:
      "A short time ago, World War I fighter ace Porco Rosso was a valiant Italian Air Force pilot. Nowadays, the ghosts of the past have transformed the mustachioed man of action into a jaded opportunist fighting for a paycheck as a bounty hunter. And haunted by guilt, Porco flies his nimble Savoia S.21 seaplane over the Adriatic Sea like there's no tomorrow. Perhaps the cynical former hero has a death wish. But everything will change when furious air pirates enlist the help of a haughty American antagonist to bring him down. Now, there is no turning back: the reclusive flying ace must pull himself together and show them who's boss. After all, the legendary Crimson Pig lives for pride, fortune, and love.—Nick Riganas",

During his journey, he meets Prince Arren, a young distraught teenage boy. While Arren may look like a shy young teen, he has a severe dark side, which grants him strength, hatred, ruthlessness and has no mercy, especially when it comes to protecting Teru.

    review:
      "The son of a sailor, 5-year-old Sosuke lives a quiet life on an oceanside cliff with his mother Lisa. One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard and a sea goddess, Ponyo uses her father's magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke, but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo's father sends the ocean's mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo's dreams of becoming human.—The Massie Twins",
